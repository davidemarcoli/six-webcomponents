# Introduction

The Web Components Library is an **in-house open source** project for developing modern web
applications that follow the SIX corporate styling guidelines.

The technology stack is based on web standards and best practices. Moreover, we try to keep it as
simple as possible for our developers. For those reasons we decided to use
[Web Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components), which are supported by all modern
browsers. The project fully supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## Install

```bash
npm install @six-group/ui-library
```

For detailed instructions tailored to specific frameworks, consult the respective guides:

- [Angular](angular.md)
- [React](react.md)

## Contribute

If you come across a bug or if something isn't functioning as expected, feel free to raise a
[Github Issue](https://github.com/six-group/six-webcomponents/issues)

## Preview Changes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/six-group/six-webcomponents.git
cd six-webcomponents
npm install
npm run start
```

The last command will open a browser window at http://localhost:3333/ providing a preview of all
components.
